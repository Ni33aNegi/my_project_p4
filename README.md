# Customer-behaviour

Here are mysql queries on a data of a random shopping area, on how a group of customers behaves across the year on the basis of shopping, subscription, discount applied, etc.

These queries complete almost every point of view on how an outsider see a shop or mall if he/she wants to analyse the activities across that particular area.

These queries also helps the management, if they want the analysis of their whole year activity of their customers. So they produce efficient amount of products so they won't get sort of supplies and can maximise profits.

Also there are python is used to fetch out data accordingly so that if one cannot understand tables, he/she can go through python scripts to see exact charts of those analysis, which is done in mysql in simpler form( also notes are written there)
